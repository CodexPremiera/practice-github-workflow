Practice Git Workflow
=====================

This repository is made to practice the **GitHub Workflow**. Some of the things practiced are:

1. Initializing a Local Git Repository.
2. Committing changes in the Local Git Repository.
3. Pushing the local repository to the remote repository (GitHub).
4. Branching out from the main repository.
5. Making, reviewing, and merging pull requests. 
6. Simulate a conflict in the main and detached branches prior to merging.

This project only demonstrates the basics of the GitHub Workflow on a small scale. But this is the first step to 
integrating future projects with version control both on local and remote environments.
